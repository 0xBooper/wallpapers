# Wallpapers
This repository contains all of the Wallpapers that I regularly use on all of my systems and phones. These wallpapers are usually actively in use in videos from my [YouTube Channel]( https://www.youtube.com/user/mackenziegcriswell ), so if you're visiting this repo from there, thanks for watching, and I hope you can find what you're looking for.

My current favorite wallpaper, is a nice piece of art featuring Ang & Appa, from [Avatar: The Last Airbender](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/):

## Organization
I've spent a bit of time trying to make sure that all of my wallpapers were organized well; mostly just because, as the library has grown very large, it's become increasingly difficult to find what I'm looking for. All of the wallpapers use a fairly simple naming scheme that looks something like this: ``generalCategory-more-specific-descriptor.jpg`` . For example: ``abstract-a.jpg`` or ``lotr-minas-tirith.jpg``. I've found that sort of *tagging* images with a general category, by using the category as a prefix in names makes the process of finding an image quite a bit easier. Displaying the images in a simple grid will have similar images grouped together, and makes the library much easier to browse casually, or with a specific intention. 

I also have split up the images into a few sub-categories, again, just to make finding a specific image easier. I don't want to create a ton of different folders, because then I'll have to end up playing a guessing game just to makes sure that I'm in the right folder, before I can look for an image. The naming system that I just laid out works really well for browsing the library, so most of the images live in the ``general`` folder. The extra directories only exist to narrow down very specific categories of wallpapers: 

1. **General**: The largest bulk of the wallpapers, almost everything lives here. 
2. **Artwork**: A collection of paintings that I like to use as wallpapers, but only on occasion. They have their own directory, because I don't want them cluttering up my main folder, and I don't apply any kind of naming convention to the images. All these images simply use the title of the painting as the filename. 
3. **Media**: This is where I keep any wallpapers that relate to a video game, or a book, or a movie, or something of that sort. It's a lot of concept art and well timed screenshots. I've just found that I don't always want these style of wallpapers to be in use, so they get their own category. 
4. **Nouns**: Originally I created this category for pictures of people that I found interesting, mainly Audrey Hepburn & Buddha. However, I've since expanded the category to include animals and a few other things, so it's just called nouns. Anything that is a *noun* get's filed here. 
5. **Tech**: I've added a fifth category for "tech" wallpapers. These are mostly some past and current default wallpapers from Windows and OSX releases; but this also includes a set of "retro tech wallpapers" that I designed a while back. You can view and access just those images [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNcKt7p6gWWk5sHYwj9SuhOHTliwypGEO-CfQCr5y4eI1qesRrH3wFOyIaQ871pGg?key=T1RSejMzUk9yUzBGaEx6LVduSmNNRW8wVnAyb2Rn) 

## Tech Specs
All of these images use the JPG format, spelled as ``.jpg``, not ``.jpeg`` for consistency. This is just to save on the file size. I find that I don't usually notice the difference between a JPG and a PNG or other higher quality image format (in the context of a wallpaper), and JPG files have significantly smaller file size; so I hope you see what I'm getting at. 

All of the wallpapers also have a minimum resolution of 1080p; and I'm slowly replacing the lower resolution wallpapers with 4K equivalents, or removing them entirely. But, for the time being, if you're using a display with a resolution higher than 1080p or so; you might be careful just picking any image at random. 

## Format
It also may be relevant to note that this library includes wallpapers intended for use on mobile (portrait) & desktop (landscape) layouts. These images aren't organized in any specific way, but the largest majority of images should also be of a high enough resolution that they can be used with either type of layout without any noticeable degradation.
