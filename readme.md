This repository contains all of the Wallpapers that I regularly use on all of my systems (and phones). These wallpapers are usually actively in use in videos from my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/mackenziegcriswell), so if you're visiting this repo from there, thanks for watching, and I hope you can find what you're looking for. 

My current favorite wallpaper is picture of some hairy penguins at a cult meeting:

## Organization
I've spent a bit of time trying to make sure that all of my wallpapers were organized well; mostly just because, as the library has grown very large, it's become increasingly difficult to find what I'm looking for. All of the wallpapers use a fairly simple naming scheme that looks something like this: ``generalCategory-more-specific-descriptor.jpg`` . For example: ``abstract-a.jpg`` or ``lotr-minas-tirith.jpg``. I've found that sort of *tagging* images with a general category, by using the category as a prefix in names makes the process of finding an image quite a bit easier. Displaying the images in a simple grid will have similar images grouped together, and makes the library much easier to browse casually, or with a specific intention. 

Originally the wallpapers were sorted into different folders, to try and make browsing easier; and it did. The problem I ran into is that as I added more categories for wallpapers, the folders were less helpful. I was having to add multiple directories to any type of wallpaper manager; and if I ever wanted to just randomly select a wallpaper from my collection; I basically couldn't. So I've kept the category denotation, I just do it as a prefix on the filenames. The images end up still being sorted by category, rather than just alphabet, or any other useless criteria; but I also get to access the wallpapers much more easily. 

That being said, the categories for my wallpapers, are: 

1. **General**: The largest bulk of the wallpapers, almost everything lives here. 

2. **Artwork**: A collection of paintings that I like to use as wallpapers.

3. **Media**: This is where I keep any wallpapers that relate to a video game, or a book, or a movie, or something of that sort. It's a lot of concept art and well timed screenshots. 

4. **Nouns**: Originally I created this category for pictures of people that I found interesting, mainly Audrey Hepburn & Buddha. However, I've since expanded the category to include animals and a few other things, so it's just called nouns. Anything that is a *noun* get's filed here. 

5. **Tech**: I've added a fifth category for "tech" wallpapers. These are mostly some past and current default wallpapers from Windows and OSX releases; but this also includes a set of "retro tech wallpapers" that I designed a while back. You can view and access just those images [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNcKt7p6gWWk5sHYwj9SuhOHTliwypGEO-CfQCr5y4eI1qesRrH3wFOyIaQ871pGg?key=T1RSejMzUk9yUzBGaEx6LVduSmNNRW8wVnAyb2Rn).

6. **Cyberpunk**: I have a new category for some cyberpunk style wallpapers. It's pretty self-explanatory. 

7. **Places**: There is a another new category now: Places. It's images of nice places in the world, or landmarks, or anything of that sort. There are some really great shots in here. 

## Tech Specs
All of these images use the JPG format, spelled as ``.jpg``, not ``.jpeg`` for consistency. This is just to save on the file size. I find that I don't usually notice the difference between a JPG and a PNG or other higher quality image format (in the context of a wallpaper), and JPG files have significantly smaller file size; so I hope you see what I'm getting at. 

All of the wallpapers also have a minimum resolution of 1080p; and I'm slowly replacing the lower resolution wallpapers with 4K equivalents, or removing them entirely. But, for the time being, if you're using a display with a resolution higher than 1080p you might be careful just picking any image at random. 

## Devices
It also may be relevant to note that this library includes wallpapers intended for use on mobile (portrait) & desktop (landscape) layouts. These images aren't organized in any specific way, but the largest majority of images should also be of a high enough resolution that they can be used with either type of layout without any noticeable degradation. That being said, I do primarily work on a desktop or a laptop; so the majority of the images are collected with that in mind. There are some images that were collected specifically for use on a phone, and are in the proper orientation, but those are few and far between. This is a collection of images for use primarily on old school, you know... computers!
